<!--
  Colonist A/B Test: Checkered CTA Buttons
  ==========================================

  Thought process:
  - Replaced <div> with semantic <button> elements for accessibility —
    they're keyboard-navigable and screen-reader-friendly out of the box,
    no extra ARIA attributes needed.
  - Single .button-container wraps both buttons as a CSS Grid to create
    the diagonal stagger — no absolute positioning, fully responsive.
  - Kept original class names (button-left-top, button-right-bottom) from
    the starter code to match the given coding style.
  - Shared child classes (.button-title, .button-subtitle) avoid
    duplicating typography styles across buttons.
  - "PLAY NOW" routes users to the main play page to start a game (primary CTA).
  - "LIVE GAMES" fetches the game list API on page load and picks a random
    live game for the user to spectate on click (secondary CTA). Falls back
    to the lobby if no games are available or the API fails.
